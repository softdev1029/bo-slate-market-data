# Binary

## Binary Overview

Binary messages send data in its native format. Binary messages are more compact and faster to process since the data does not need to be converted from a string to the native format and because the offset of desired fields are known and can be accessed using an offset to find the desired field.

Binary messages are identical in TCP/IP and in Websockets. The sending of the messages is the same and the receiving of messages is the same therefore the descriptions of the following messages will work the same for TCP/IP and for Websockets.
